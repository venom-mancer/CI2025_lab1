## Model Review – Hill Climbing for the Knapsack Problem

### Weaknesses
- **Poor exploration vs. exploitation balance:**  
  Pure HC focuses on immediate improvements (exploitation) and performs very little exploration.  
  A better balance between exploration and exploitation would improve robustness.

- **Limited neighborhood:**  
  The neighborhood (single-item flip) is quite restrictive. With this setup, the algorithm may easily get stuck in configurations  
  where no single move improves the value, even though combinations of two or more flips could lead to better solutions.

- **Lack of diversification:**  
  Since HC accepts only improving moves, it can become trapped in local maxima.  
  No mechanism is implemented to escape these situations (e.g., temporary acceptance of worse moves or restarts).

- **Missing structured stopping criteria:**  
  The model lacks explicit conditions such as a maximum number of iterations without improvement or a time limit.  
  Including such criteria would make the behavior more stable and reproducible.

### Suggested improvements for better results

#### Expand the neighborhood
Allow more complex moves, such as:
- **1–1 swaps** (remove one item and add another in the same step);  
- **multi-item swaps** (remove or add two items at a time).  
This helps overcome cases where a single flip is not enough to improve the solution.

#### Accept controlled worsening moves
Incorporate a mechanism similar to **Simulated Annealing (SA)**, which occasionally accepts worse solutions,  
especially in the early stages.  
This helps the search escape local traps and explore new areas of the solution space.

#### Add diversification
Introduce strategies such as:
- a **tabu list** to temporarily forbid recently used moves, avoiding cycles;  
- an **Iterated Local Search** phase, where after stagnation the best solution found is slightly perturbed  
  and the HC is restarted from there.  
These strategies improve coverage of the search space.

#### Handle stagnation more effectively
Define clear stopping rules, such as:
- a **stagnation threshold** (no improvement for *N* iterations) 
- a **maximum execution time**.  
When such limits are reached, perform a restart or diversification step.

#### Refine the repair function
When a solution exceeds capacity, remove items with the **lowest value-to-weight ratio** until the constraint is satisfied.  
This preserves as much total value as possible while restoring feasibility.

### Code clarity
It would benefit from:
- concise **docstrings** describing each function’s purpose, move type, and stopping criterion;
These additions would make the implementation clearer and easier to maintain.

### Overall evaluation
The **Hill Climbing with repair** model is a solid and consistent baseline for tackling the knapsack problem.  
It demonstrates good local improvement capabilities but lacks broader exploration:  
it tends to stop too early and fails to reach more promising regions of the search space.  

The proposed enhancements — expanding the neighborhood, allowing controlled acceptance of worse solutions,  
and introducing diversification mechanisms — would make the heuristic **more robust and less dependent on the starting point**.
